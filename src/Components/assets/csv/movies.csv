As the pressure builds and Knobel is forced to deliver more and more volumes of the fake diaries, he finds himself acting increasingly like the man whose life he is rewriting.

In Baldi’s movie, Orestes is called Sebastian, a man living on his own. One day a wounded stranger called Rafael/Pylades takes shelter in his house and tells him that he, Sebastian, is the son of a Mexican general who was murdered by his wife and her lover. Sebastian has no recollection of the massacre, but the tolling of the bells announcing the Ave Maria bring back fragmented memories. Finally Sebastian is re-united with his sister Isabella and together they avenge the murder of their father. The film is a bit confusing from time to time, with a storyline that seems over-complicated for a spaghetti western, but patient and attentive viewers are rewarded. The Forgotten Pistolero is also known for Roberto Pregadio’s awesome score.","/cxvnt9kGR4vIZzZ8HjBzzwbHoeB.jpg",2.941,"/uOemCobkCELstrVF6ODCNg6lBel.jpg","88","1969-10-17",6.1,24,"2023-06-21 14:43:23.503-04","2023-06-21 14:43:23.503-04"

Through personal recollection and rare home movie footage, it documents the director's early life, from experiments with his first camera, via his deviation from a career in medicine in favour of art and film, through to international recognition for the Road Trilogy. Central to these were themes that became cornerstones of all his work: national identity, the importance of personal relationships and the allure of the road.  With contributions from the director and the many collaborators who helped define his vision, One Who Set Forth is a compelling account of Wim Wenders' life and work.","/rQAfwZgIZgSkZqbiVINTnbOxaDk.jpg",0.652,"/bx0fifvEcsamEQWb61qU7sBXbRA.jpg","96","2008-01-24",8.5,2,"2023-06-21 14:44:33.461-04","2023-06-21 14:44:33.461-04"

The old Titãs material is also excellent, as for example the hit ""Cegos do Castelo,"" the reggae ""Marvin"" and the slightly odd but humorous ""Não Vou Me Adaptar."" The mildly meditative ""Mantra"" is another highlight. On ""Pomar"" Reis is joined by the young band Ultramen from Rio Grande do Sul.
